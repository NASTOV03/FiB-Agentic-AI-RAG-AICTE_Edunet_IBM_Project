# 🤖 FiB - Fitness Buddy (AICTE-Edunet-IBM-Internship-Project)

**FiB** is an AI-powered virtual health and wellness coach built using **IBM Cloud** services. It provides intelligent, personalized fitness guidance, motivation, nutrition tips, and habit-building strategies through natural conversations. Accessible anytime, anywhere. 🚀🏋️‍♂️

# **SMART AI FITNESS COACH FOR DAILY WELLNESS**

## **📌 Overview**
This project is an AI-based **Fitness Assistant** designed to help individuals stay consistent with healthy routines. It uses **Watson Assistant**, **Granite LLM**, and IBM **Vector Knowledge Grounding** to provide a full AI stack experience on the cloud without requiring complex backend systems.

FiB is designed for:
- People with limited time or access to gyms
- Beginners who need simple fitness guidance
- Anyone looking for daily health motivation

## **🚀 Features**

### **🏋️ Personalized Fitness Coach**
- Answers fitness-related queries conversationally
- Recommends **home workouts** based on time & level
- Suggests **easy, healthy meals** with nutrition value

### **💬 Chatbot Powered by Watson**
- Built using **IBM Watson Assistant** with intents for:
  - `#workout`
  - `#motivation`
  - `#nutrition`
  - `#habit_building`

### **📘 Knowledge Grounding with Vectorized PDF**
- Integrated **2MB fitness knowledge base**
- Grounded with **IBM Granite** for enhanced conversational intelligence

### **📊 Uses IBM Jupyter Notebooks**
- For additional AI experimentation or fine-tuning logic

## **📄 How It Works**

1️⃣ **User interacts with FiB via Watson Assistant**  
2️⃣ **Asks a question**, like:
- "Give me a 15-minute workout"
- "What’s a good breakfast after a run?"
- "Motivate me to stay active"

3️⃣ **Watson Assistant responds**, grounded in vectorized PDF knowledge using IBM Granite

4️⃣ **User receives customized suggestions** or motivational responses
